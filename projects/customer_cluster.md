# SkyLink Communications Customer Cluster Analysis

## Overview

In this project, we used cluster analysis to segment the diverse customer base of SkyLink Communications into distinct groups. This segmentation helps us understand customer behaviors and preferences better, enabling us to tailor our marketing strategies more effectively. The analysis focused on key customer attributes such as tenure, service usage, and charges.

## Key Steps and Insights

### Data Preparation and Exploration

I began by preparing and exploring the data, focusing on key continuous variables that influence customer behavior:

- **Customer Tenure**: Understanding how long customers stay with us helps identify loyalty patterns.
- **Service Usage**: Analyzing local, international calls, and data usage provides insights into customer needs and preferences.
- **Charges**: Examining charges for services helps in identifying customers' willingness to pay and their service tiers.

### Data Normalization

To ensure a fair comparison, we normalized the data, making sure each variable equally contributed to the clustering process.

### Determining the Optimal Number of Clusters

Using the Elbow Method, we determined that four clusters were optimal for our data. This method helped us identify the point where adding more clusters didnâ€™t significantly improve the model.

### K-Means Clustering

I performed k-means clustering and identified four distinct customer segments:

1. **Global Communicators**
2. **Data Enthusiasts**
3. **Emerging Users**
4. **Local Loyalists**
